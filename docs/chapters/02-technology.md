# Technology Overview

::: summary :::

Lantern teaches two production workflows that use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to format chapter content and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to produce open textbooks in multiple formats from a single source. Specifically, Lantern will help you...

1. Convert textbook manuscripts from common word processing formats to Markdown
2. Format chapter content using Markdown syntax with a text editor
3. Publish textbooks as a website with PDF, EPUB, and word processing format download options

**Lantern assumes no prior experience with writing code.** Lantern provides all of the necessary guides, templates, and scripts to begin publishing open textbooks.

## Selecting a Production Workflow

We recommend the online workflow to first-time users of Lantern and the Desktop workflow to advanced users looking for more flexibility and customization.

- The **online** workflow is the simpler option, but it relies on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for document processing. Some free software installation is recommended but not required. This workflow does not use the command line.

- The **desktop** workflow is more complicated, but removes GitHub as a dependency. Some free software installation is required. This workflow uses the command line to run scripts that Lantern provides.

Both workflows use [GitHub Pages](https://https://pages.github.com/) as a web hosting service, but the output files can be uploaded to any other basic web hosting service. 

## Processing Software

Lantern uses a few open source programs to make the publishing outputs, but you won't interact with these programs directly if you're using the online workflow:

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) uses the Markdown source files to produce the textbook editions
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is used by Pandoc to typeset and build the PDF edition
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is the shell used for handling input and output files
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) simplifies the production settings and processes

The online workflow provides a GitHub repository that is preconfigured to run all of the required processing scripts using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). The Desktop workflow requires installing and using Pandoc, LaTeX, Bash, and Make to produce the output files on your computer.

| Requirements | Online | Desktop |
|-|-|-|
| Text Editor | Yes | Yes |
| Word Processor | Yes | Yes |
| GitHub Account | Yes | No |
| Pandoc | No | Yes |
| LaTeX | No | Yes |
| Bash | No | Yes |
| Make | No | Yes |

## Document Markup in Manuscript Files

Word processing formats like `.docx`, `.odt`, or `.rtf` are helpful to authors for writing their manuscripts, but can be problematic for digital production and archiving because editors like Microsoft Word and Google Docs obscure the semantic elements of the document. 

::: example :::

For example, a Microsoft Word document might visually display a subheading using centered horizontal alignment and a bold typeface. While humans may be able to understand this as a heading, screen-readers wouldn't be able to distiguish it from any other paragraph in the document. Document markup identifies semantic elements explicitly through the use of tags. 

:::

Lantern requires manuscript files to be formatted as Markdown (`.md`) files. Markdown is the syntax and file format we'll use for tagging structural elements within the textbook chapters, such as headings.

> The idea is to identify logical structures in your document (a title, sections, subsections, footnotes, etc.), mark them with some unobtrusive characters, and then “compile” the resulting text with a typesetting interpreter which will format the document consistently, according to a specified style.

### Markdown Tutorial

This video explains the basics of Markdown syntax. While it is true that Markdown was designed as a simplified alternative to writing content for HTML, Lantern uses Markdown to write several additional output formats.

One downside to Markdown is that is it not a markup language that has been standardized. There are a few specifications that aim to standardize Markdown, but generally the Markdown syntax rules are set by the Markdown processor, or engine. Since Lantern uses Pandoc as it's Markdown processor, we'll be using [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) to format our textbooks.

:::

Lantern provides guidance and tools to simplify the conversion process from common word processing formats (`.docx`, `.odt`, or `.rtf`) to Markdown. The conversions won't be perfect, but they'll save you a lot of time.

If you're starting with Microsoft Word files, you'll need the ability to open the files and apply styles to chapter contents, such as headings. We recommend [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word?rtc=1) as your word processor, but [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) will also work. 

## Markdown: Adding Structure to Documents

You can create and edit Markdown files using a text editor. Every operating system includes a default plain text editor. On Windows, the default editor is [Notepad](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-notepad/9msmlrh6lzf3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab); on macOS, the default editor is [TextEdit](https://support.apple.com/guide/textedit/welcome/mac). Both of these options will work, as well as any other text editor, but we recommend installing [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is free for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

::: aside :::

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be customized to your workflow with [Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/). You might be interested in trying a few extensions to help with formatting Markdown documents. Here are a few popular options:

- [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath): Preview LaTeX math equation rendering
- [Markdown Table Prettifier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=darkriszty.markdown-table-prettify): Auto-format markdown tables for easier readability
- [Excel to Markdown Table](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csholmq.excel-to-markdown-table): Copy tables from [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) and paste as Markdown tables

## Pandoc: Building Textbook Editions

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is the primary document processing software that Lantern uses to convert manuscript files into multiple textbook editions. Pandoc was designed to be a "universal document converter" for various markup formats.  

### Lantern supported file formats

Lantern provides [conversion scripts](https://github.com/nulib-oer/lantern/blob/main/assets/scripts/word-formats.sh) for a subset of file formats that Pandoc is able to convert. 

| File Extensions | Format             | Related Applications                     |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `.docx`         | Open Office XML    | Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice |
| `.odt`          | Open Document Text | Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice |
| `.tex`          | LaTeX              | Plain text editor (e.g. VS Code)     |

Lantern also provides [templates](https://github.com/nulib-oer/lantern/tree/main/assets/templates) for producing multiple publication formats from Markdown.

| File Extensions | Format             | Related Applications                          |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `.odt`          | Open Document Text | Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice      |
| `.tex`          | LaTeX              | Plain text editor (e.g. VS Code)              |
| `.html`         | HTML 5             | web browsers                                  |
| `.epub`         | EPUB 3             | Calibre, Adobe Digital Editions, web browsers |
| `.pdf`          | PDF                | Adobe Acrobat Reader, web Browsers            |
