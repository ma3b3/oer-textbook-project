# Introduction

::: summary :::

"[Minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/)" is a critical framework that places limits on hardware and software choices in order to prioritize the longevity of digital texts, the mitigation of technological obscolescence, and the maintenance of publishing systems. Lantern applies this framework to the production the open textbooks.

Lantern explores the potential for using Markdown as a typesetting format for publishing. 

> "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions." - [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)

Lantern uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) as it's processing engine and provides options for employing it's workflow, with or without installing any software. 

## Features

- **Free:** Lantern uses free and open source software and web services for processing, building, deploying, and hosting open textbooks. 

- **Portable:** Lantern emphasizes the use of plain text file formats that can run on any machine or web host. No databases or servers are required. 

- **Multi-format:** Lantern teaches semantic markup technologies for producing Markdown, HTML, PDF, and DOCX editions of open textbooks. 

- **Sustainable:** Lantern minimizes the infrastructure, configuration, hosting, and maintenance costs related to traditional digital publishing systems.

> Plain text files have many advantages over other formats. For one, they are readable on virtually all devices. They have also withstood the test of time better than other file types – if you’ve ever tried to open a document saved in a legacy word processor format, you’ll be familiar with the compatibility challenges involved.[@simpkin_getting_2015]

Lantern is a project by Chris Diaz (Digital Publishing Librarian) and Lauren McKeen McDonald (Open Education Librarian) of Northwestern University with support from the [Association of Research Libraries](https://www.arl.org/). Lantern is based on [Pandoc Book Template](https://github.com/wikiti/pandoc-book-template), and was inspired by numerous publishing tools, including [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), [Course-in-a-Box](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/), [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), and [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/).
